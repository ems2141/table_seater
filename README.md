table_seater
============

This app is a table seater which accepts an array of people and organizes a seating chart based on their preferences of who they absolutely need to sit next to and who they would not be able to tolerate for a meal.

Initially this app will accept an array of people and return an ordered array representing a seating chart.  As a next step, the app will become interactive and ask a user who they want to sit next to, and who they do not. 
It will also ask they user how many people will sit at a table and divide the ordered array by that amount to return a full seating chart for an event.
